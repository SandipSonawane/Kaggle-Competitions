## About Competition

This competition is based on automatically localizing and classifying 14 types of thoracic abnormalities from chest radiographs. The dataset consists of 18,000 scans that have been annotated by experienced radiologists. The model needs to be trained on 15,000 independently-labeled images and will be evaluated on a test set of 3,000 images. These annotations were collected via VinBigData's web-based platform, VinLab.

If successful, it can be used as a valuable second opinion for radiologists. An automated system that could accurately identify and localize findings on chest radiographs would relieve the stress of busy doctors while also providing patients with a more accurate diagnosis.
